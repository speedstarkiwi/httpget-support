# httpget-support

'omg i can run httpget now!' - this will make `game:HttpGet` work for you now! [works with any method as it should]

[it also makes HttpGetAsync run as an extra but its super simple too lmao]

# what is this?

game:HttpGet is a function in exploits that does HTTP GET request to a URL and retrieve the response. It can be returned or just running scripts in general. 

# how to use?

[compiler]: add into your execute function **before compiling the script** [or you could use cross bytecode replacement as well but thats advanced]

[wrapper]: add this before the script is ran (should be replaced in code block 1)

[lbi]: pass to compiler as well

[others]: same as wrapper
